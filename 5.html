You have to match the colours on the screen which is harder than you think.  At the end of the game, you are given a score and therefore the excuse to play again as you have something to beat!</p> <p> </p> Zentangle Feathers Tone &#038; Value Resource Drawing Features of the Face <p> More Games Below!</p> <h4> Street Art</h4> <p> Street art is a game by The Tate.  I have mixed opinions about this one as it&#8217;s quite limited, although I do like the wall background and the spray paints.  What do you think?</p> <p> </p> <h4> Jig Zone</h4> <p> Jig zone is an online puzzle site with an art section.  Students do the puzzles by dragging the pieces into place.  A simple activity to fill the end of a lesson if you only have 5 minutes left and starting something else would be unwise at that point.</p> <h4> </h4> <h4> Quick, Draw!</h4> <p> &#8216;Quick, Draw!&#8217; is interesting as it asks the question &#8216;Can a neural network learn to recognize doodling?&#8217;  It asks you to add to the worlds largest doodling dataset.  You have 20 seconds to draw the items it asks for.  I think the learning here is simply opening children&#8217;s minds to the idea that a computer can learn.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <h4> Auto Draw</h4> <p> Auto draw&#8217;s main feature is that you start drawing and it tries to recognise what you are drawing.  You can then click on the picture and your drawing turns into that picture.  There is a useful tutorial if click on the menu in the top left-hand corner under &#8216;How to&#8217;. You can add text and shapes.  There are more colours than you might think in the colour picker.  I think you could use the shapes and colours and text to teach colour theory.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <h4> Kern Me</h4> <p> If you teach graphics you will love this game.  Kerning is the spacing between letters or characters in a piece of text.  This game teaches students to create the correct spacing by eye.  Great fun!</p> <p> </p> <h4> Shape Type</h4> <p> &#8216;Shape Type&#8217; is a letter shaping game.  Students need to move points on the letter to try and get a pleasing shape to the letter.  Super tricky but quite addictive!</p> <p> </p> <h4> 50 Famous Paintings</h4> <p> &#8216;Can you name the 50 Famous Paintings&#8217; is on the &#8216;How Stuff Works&#8217; website and has many easily recognisable paintings.</p> <p> </p> <h4> TriviaPlaza</h4> <p> TriviaPlaza is a quiz site which has an art section.  Be warned they quizzes are difficult.  Suitable for frustrating bright students aged 16+ or for art teachers to test their knowledge!</p> <p> </p> <p> I&#8217;d love to keep adding to this blog post, so if you know of any cool online art learning games, please comment below.</p> <p> Don&#8217;t forget to check out all the Free Resources on The Arty Teacher! </p> <p> </p> <h3> The Arty Teacher </h3> <p> Sarah Crowther is The Arty Teacher.

I’ll send on some of these art challenges to my students.</p> The Arty Teacher March 30, 2020 at 3:46 pm <p> Thanks Scott. I&#8217;m pleased you&#8217;re finding it useful.</p> jleigh March 16, 2020 at 6:56 pm <p> Thanks for all the goodies!<br/> kleki.com is a great online painting tool!</p> Edward Schweizer January 31, 2020 at 6:30 pm <p> Thank you for this! Unfortunately, my district blocks websites for no apparent reason and a couple of the games won&#8217;t work for my students.</p> The Arty Teacher January 31, 2020 at 7:00 pm <p> Hi Edward, It&#8217;s unfortunate when schools block useful websites. I&#8217;ve checked all the games and they work on my computer, so I suspect your student&#8217;s computers might need a flash plugin or some other sort of update. Thanks for your comment, Sarah.</p> Jaylynn Lusk December 17, 2019 at 10:01 pm <p> Great website!! One of my personal favorites!!! ❤❤❤</p> The Arty Teacher December 18, 2019 at 8:06 am <p> Thanks Jaylynn, It&#8217;s lovely to hear that The Arty Teacher is a favorite!
